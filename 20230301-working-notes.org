* Experiments

** Q: Can Matthew add a new RTS function, exposed as a Prim.XYZ function by the compiler to a test?
*** Began: 
*** Implemented a global counter in the RTS as a mutable global (REGION_NEXT_ID).
*** Exposed Prim.regionNextId
*** Made a passing test that calls that function and asserts its expected value.
*** 20230301-1539: Success (also wrote this summary).




** Q: Can Matthew support the legacy API with the new primitives and a special region?
*** Advice from Claudio on 20230228 during our team call.
*** TO DO
